IKEA listened to what people said and made it better. They made it easier to build, added shelves you can move, and made it in different sizes. Now, the BILLY is stronger and uses better materials. IKEA even uses recycled wood to help the planet.</p>

Now, Dyson vacuums are famous for being powerful and clever.</p>

                        <p>Every time something fails, you learn something new. Designers test, improve, and try again. Failure is not the end—it's a way to find better solutions. This is important in all design and technology work.</p>
